            Pakistan has a total area of 803,940 square kilometers, slightly greater than France and the United Kingdom put together.
    <p>

            <br>Pakistan is located in South Asia. To the south is the Arabian Sea, with 1,046 km of Pakistani coastline.
            <br> To Pakistan’s east is India, which has a 2,912 km border with Pakistan. To its west is Iran,
            <br> which has a 909 km border with Pakistan. To Pakistan’s northwest lies Afghanistan, with a shared border of 2,430 km.
            <br> China is towards the northeast and has a 523 km border with Pakistan.
  
    </p>
       
    <p>

        <br>The main waterway of Pakistan is the Indus River that begins in China, and runs nearly the entire length of Pakistan,
        <br> flowing through all of Pakistan’s provinces except Balochistan. is fed by the combined waters of
        <br> three of the five rivers of Punjab the Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi.
        <br> The waters of the other two rivers, the Beas and the Sutlej, are largely withdrawn for irrigation in India.
        <br> Along the Indus and its tributaries are found most of Pakistan’s population, its chief agricultural areas, and its major hydroelectric power stations,
        <br> interconnected by the world’s largest system of agricultural canals, join the Indus before it discharges into the Arabian Sea.
    </p>
<p>            
    <br>The northern and western areas of Pakistan are mountainous.
    <br> Pakistani administered areas of Kashmir contain some of the highest mountains in the world,
    <br> including the second tallest, K-2. Northern Pakistan tends to receive more rainfall than the southern parts of the country,
    <br> and has some areas of preserved moist temperate forest. In the southeast, Pakistan’s border with India passes through a flat desert,
    <br> called the Cholistan or Thal Desert.
    <br> West-central Baluchistan has a high desert plateau, bordered by low mountain ranges.
    <br> Most of the Punjab, and parts of Sindh, are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.

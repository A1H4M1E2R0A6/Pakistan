    <h1 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">Geography</h1>

    <p>
        <br> The Geography of Pakistan is a profound blend of landscapes varying from plains to deserts,
        <br>forests, and plateaus ranging from the coastal areas of the Arabian Sea in the south to the mountains of the
        Karakoram,
        <br>Hindukush, Himalayas ranges in the north. Pakistan geologically overlaps both with the Indian and the
        Eurasian tectonic
        <br>plates where its Sindh and Punjab provinces lie on the north-western corner of the Indian plate while
        Balochistan and
        <br> most of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa lie within the Eurasian plate which mainly comprises the Iranian Plateau.
    </p>

    <p>
        <br> Pakistan is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the northwest and Iran to the west while China
        borders
        <br> the country in the northeast. The nation is geopolitically situated within some of the most controversial
        regional boundaries
        <br> which share disputes and have many-a-times escalated military tensions between the nations, e.g., that of
        Kashmir with India and
        <br> the Durand Line with Afghanistan. Its western borders include the Khyber Pass and Bolan Pass that have
        served as traditional migration routes between Central Eurasia and South Asia.
    </p>

    <p>
        <br> At 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 sq mi), Pakistan is the 33rd largest country by area,
        <br> little more than twice the size of the US state of California, and slightly larger than the Canadian
        province of Alberta.

    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);"> International boundaries:</h3>
    <p>
        Pakistan shares its borders with four neighboring countries - People's Republic of China, Afghanistan,
        India, and Iran while Tajikistan is separated by thin Wakhan Corridor– adding up to about 7,307 km (4,540.4 mi)
        in length
        (excluding the coastal areas).
    </p>

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">Afghanistan–Pakistan border:</h4>
    The border with Afghanistan which is known as the Durand Line, 2,430 km (1,509.9 mi), which runs from the Hindu Kush
    and the Pamir Mountains. A narrow strip of Afghanistan territory called the Wakhan Corridor extends between Pakistan
    and Tajikistan.

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);"> China–Pakistan border:</h4>
    The eastern tip of the Wakhan Corridor starts the Sino-Pak border between the People's Republic of China and
    Pakistan spanning about 559 km (347.3 mi). It carries on south-eastward and ends near the Karakoram Pass. This line
    was determined from 1961 to 1965 in a series of agreements between China and Pakistan and finally on 3 March 1963
    both the governments, of Islamabad and Beijing, formally agreed. It is understood that if the dispute over Kashmir
    is resolved, the border would need to be discussed again.[1]

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">India–Pakistan border:</h4>
    The Northern Areas has five of the world's seventeen highest peaks along with highest range of mountains the
    Karakoram and Himalayas. It also has such extensive glaciers that it has sometimes been called the "Third Pole". The
    international border-line has been a matter of pivotal dispute between Pakistan and India ever since 1947, and the
    Siachen Glacier in northern Kashmir has been an important arena for fighting between the two sides since 1984,
    although far more soldiers have died of exposure to the cold than from any skirmishes in the conflict between their
    National Armies facing each other.

    The Pakistan-India ceasefire line runs from the Karakoram Pass west-southwest to a point about 130 kilometres
    northwest of Lahore. This line, about 770 kilometres long, was arranged with United Nations (UNO) assistance at the
    end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–48. The ceasefire line came into effect on 1 January 1949, after eighteen
    months of fighting between Indian forces and Pakistani forces and was last adjusted and agreed upon by the two
    countries according to the Shimla Agreement of 2 July 1972 between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Since
    then, it has been generally known as the Line of Control or the (LoC).

    The India–Pakistan border continues irregularly southward for about 1,280 kilometers, following the Radcliffe line,
    named for Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the head of the British Boundary Commission on the division of the Punjab and Bengal
    provinces of British India on 13 August 1947.

    The southern borders are far less contentious than those in northern Pakistan (Kashmir). The Thar Desert in the
    province of Sindh is separated in the south from the salt flats of the Rann of Kachchh (Kutch) by a boundary that
    was first delineated in 1923–24. After independence and dissolution of Empire, Independent and free Pakistan
    contested the southern boundary of Sindh, and a succession of border incidents resulted. They were less dangerous
    and less widespread, however, than the conflict that erupted in Kashmir in the Indo-Pakistani War of August 1965
    started with this decisive core of issues. These southern hostilities were ended by British mediation during Harold
    Wilson's era, and both sides accepted the award of the Indo-Pakistan Western Boundary Case Tribunal designated by
    the UN secretary general himself. The tribunal made its award on 19 February 1968; delimiting a line of 403
    kilometres that was later demarcated by joint survey teams, of its original claim of some 9,100 square kilometres,
    Pakistan was awarded only about 780 square kilometers. Beyond the western terminus of the tribunal's award, the
    final stretch of Pakistan's border with India is about 80 kilometres long, running east and southeast of Sindh to an
    inlet of the Arabian Sea.

    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">Iran–Pakistan border:</h4>
    The boundary with Iran, 959 km (595.9 mi), was first delimited by a British commission in the same year as the
    Durand Line was demarcated, separating Iran from what was then British India's Baluchistan province.[1] Modern Iran
    has a province named Sistan va Baluchistan that borders Pakistan and has Baluchis in an ethnic majority. In 1957
    Pakistan signed a frontier agreement with Iran in Rawalpindi according to which the border was officially declared
    and the two countries haven't had this border as a subject of serious dispute at all.

    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS: </h3>


    <p>
        <br>Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the Indus River plain, with
        two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of Punjab and Sindh;
        <br>and the Balochistan Plateau.Some geographers designate additional major regions.
        <br>For example, the mountain ranges along the western border with Afghanistan are sometimes described
        separately from the Balochistan Plateau,
        <br>and on the eastern border with India, south of the Sutlej River, the Thar Desert may be considered
        separately from the Indus Plain.
        <br>Nevertheless, the country may conveniently be visualized in general terms as divided in three by an
        imaginary line drawn eastward from the Khyber Pass
        <br>and another drawn southwest from Islamabad down the middle of the country. Roughly, then, the northern
        highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line;
        <br> the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the
        east of that line.[citation needed]
    </p>
    <h4 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);"> The Northern Highlands:</h4>
    <p>
        <br>The northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram Range, and the Himalayas.
        <br>This area includes such famous peaks as K2[3] (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak
        in the world).
        <br>More than one-half of the summits are over 4,500 meters, and more than fifty peaks reach above 6,500 meters.
        <br>Travel through the area is difficult and dangerous, although the government is attempting to develop certain
        areas into tourist and
        <br>trekking sites. Because of their rugged topography and the rigors of the climate,the northern highlands and
        the Himalayas to the east have been formidable barriers to movement into Pakistan throughout history.
    </p>

    <p>
        <br>South of the northern highlands and west of the Indus River plain are the Safed Koh Range along the
        Afghanistan border and the Suleiman Rangeand Kirthar Range,
        <br>which define the western extent of the province of Sindh and reach almost to the southern coast.
        <br>The lower reaches are far more arid than those in the north, and they branch into ranges that run generally
        to the southwest across the province Balochistan.
        <br>North-south valleys in Balochistan and Sindh have restricted the migration of peoples along the Makran Coast
        on the Arabian Sea east toward the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>Several large passes cut the ranges along the border with Afghanistan.
        <br>Among them are the Khojak Pass, about eighty kilometres northwest of Quetta in Balochistan; the Khyber Pass,
        <br>forty kilometres west of Peshawar and leading to Kabul; and the Broghol Pass in the far north, providing
        access to the Wakhan Corridor.
    </p>

    <p>
        <br>Less than one-fifth of Pakistan's land area has the potential for intensive agricultural use.
        <br>Nearly all of the arable land is actively cultivated, but outputs are low by world standards.
        <br>Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western plateaus, but the
        Indus River basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has fertile soil
        <br>that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.
    </p>
    <b style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">The Indus plain:</b>
    <p>
        <br>The name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word hindu, meaning ocean, from which also come the words Sindh,
        Hindu, and India.
        <br>The Indus, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern Tibet only about 160 kilometres west
        of the source of the Sutlej River,
        <br>which first flows through Punjab, India and joins the Indus in Pakistani Punjab, and the Brahmaputra, which
        runs eastward before turning southwest
        <br>and flowing through India and, Bangladesh. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million
        square kilometres,
        <br>and all of Pakistan's major rivers—the Kabul, Jhelum, and Chenab—flow into it. The Indus River basin is a
        large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus.
        <br>This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">Balochistan:</b>
    <p>


        <br>Balochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between
        Southwest, Central, and South Asia.
        <br>It is geographically the largest of the four provinces at 347,190 km² (134,051 square miles) of Pakistani
        territory; and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan.
        <br>The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water.
        <br>The southern region is known as Makran. The central region is known as Kalat.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>The Sulaiman Mountains dominate the northeast corner and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan
        towards Kandahar.
        <br>Much of the province south of the Quetta region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable towns
        mostly near rivers and streams.
        <br>The largest desert is the Kharan Desert which occupies the most of Kharan District.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br> This area is subject to frequent seismic disturbances because the tectonic plate under the Indian plate
        hits the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move
        <br>northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher.
        <br> The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to earthquakes. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by one of
        more destructive force in 1935.
        <br>The small city of Quetta was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily
        damaged.
        <br>At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of Quetta.
        <br> The most recent major earthquakes include the October 2005 Kashmir earthquake in which nearly 10,000 people
        died[4] and the 2008 Balochistan earthquake occurred in
        <br>October 2008 in which 215 people were killed. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages
        in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa,
        <br> but far fewer people were killed in the quake than died in 1935.
        <br> A major earthquake centered in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage
    </p>

    <h3 style="background-color: rgb(77, 248, 77);">CLIMATE:</h3>
    <p>



        <br> Pakistan lies in the temperate zone, immediately above the tropic of cancer.
        <br> The climate varies from tropical to temperate. Arid conditions exist in the coastal south, characterized by
        a monsoon season
        <br>with adequate rainfall and a dry season with lesser rainfall, while abundant rainfall is experienced by the
        province of Punjab,
        <br>and wide variations between extremes of temperature at given locations.
        <br> Rainfall varies from as little as less than 10 inches a year to over 150 inches a year, in various parts of
        the nation.
        <br> These generalizations should not, however, obscure the distinct differences existing among particular
        locations.
        <br> For example, the coastal area along the Arabian Sea is usually warm, whereas the frozen snow-covered ridges
        of the Karakoram Range
        <br> and of other mountains of the far north are so cold year round that they are only accessible by world-class
        climbers for a few weeks in May and June of each year.

    <ul>
        <b>Pakistan has four seasons:</b>
        <br>
        <li> a cool, dry winter marked by mild temperatures from December through February;</li>
        <li>a hot, dry spring from March through May;</li>
        <li> the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September;</li>
